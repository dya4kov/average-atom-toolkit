Simulations of materials in extremes require high-quality wide-range equations of state. Average Atom Tools are designed to provide electron properties at high temperatures: energy spectrum, electron density, self-consistent potential, and equation of state. The approach is based on the Finite Temperature Thomas-Fermi atom model with its extensions and corrections.
